# Flapbird Game

Flapbird is a simple and fun web-based game inspired by the classic Flappy Bird. The objective of the game is to navigate a bird through a series of pipes without hitting them. The game is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **index.html**: The main HTML document that sets up the structure of the game. It includes the canvas element for rendering the game and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- **styles.css**: Contains the styles for the game, including layout, colors, and fonts. It styles the canvas and any other UI elements present in the game.
- **script.js**: Implements the game logic. It includes functions for initializing the game, handling user input (like flapping the bird), updating the game state, and rendering graphics on the canvas.

## How to Play

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Click on the canvas or press the spacebar to make the bird flap.
3. Avoid hitting the pipes to keep the game going.
4. Try to achieve the highest score possible!
